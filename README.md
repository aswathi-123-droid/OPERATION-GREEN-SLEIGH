*   **🎅 Interactive Cyber-Santa:** A lively, animated Santa avatar that hops around the screen and provides real-time, AI-generated voice status updates based on current mission stats.
*   **📊 Live Stats Panel:** Real-time tracking of active threats, deployed elves, and sectors secured.
*   **🎨 Cyber-Christmas Aesthetic:** A stunning "Glassmorphism" UI with neon accents, dynamic animations, and a festive dark mode.
